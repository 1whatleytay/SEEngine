# SEEngine

An game and application engine made in Java and OpenGL 2.1.
Completely outdated and really old (but I have a soft spot in my heart for it T_T).

I made this back in grade 8 or 9.
I've made a few engines before this but this was the first one that was capable enough and used OpenGL.
I'm uploading it for archive purposes.
One day I will look back and laugh at my code.
